**Where** The Digital Scholarship Research Institute will be hosted in the newly renovated Lutnick Library at Haverford College 

**When** May 2-3, 2023. Workshops and events will be held 9:00 A.M. - 5:00 P.M. on May 2nd, and 9:00 A.M. - 2:30 P.M. on May 3rd.  

Breakfast, lunch, and snacks will be catered on both days, and a beer and wine reception with hors d'oeuvres will be provided on the first day.

Because an essential aspect of the DSRI is building community among Tri-Co faculty members interested in digital scholarship, participants are expected to commit to attending the full two-day experience and to attend all of the workshops, seminars, and events during this time.
