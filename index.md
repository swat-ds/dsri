# About DSRI

The TriCo Digital Scholarship Research Institute is an intensive, cohort-based learning program developed and taught by the TriCo Libraries Digital Scholarship Group. Over the course of two days of workshops, discussions, and project showcases, participants gain experience with fundamental digital scholarship tools and methods but also explore project support and grant opportunities in the Trico and beyond, crafting potential projects and digital assignments, and wayfinding through the maze of possible tools, services, and platforms for digital research. All TriCo faculty and staff are welcome to apply, whether they are new to digital scholarship or interested in taking existing skills to the next level.


### DSRI 2023
**Where** The Digital Scholarship Research Institute will be hosted in the newly renovated Lutnick Library at Haverford College 

**When** May 2-3, 2023. Workshops and events will be held 9:00 A.M. - 5:00 P.M. on May 2nd, and 9:00 A.M. - 2:30 P.M. on May 3rd.  

Breakfast, lunch, and snacks will be catered on both days, and a beer and wine reception with hors d'oeuvres will be provided on the first day.

Because an essential aspect of the DSRI is building community among Tri-Co faculty members interested in digital scholarship, participants are expected to commit to attending the full two-day experience and to attend all of the workshops, seminars, and events during this time. 

Space is limited, so please register by April 3, 2023.
