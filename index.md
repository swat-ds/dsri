# **Digital Scholarship Research Institute 2021**

The Trico Libraries Digital Scholarship Group is pleased to announce the 2021 Trico Digital Scholarship Research Institute (DSRI), a program of two half-days of online workshops, discussions, and project showcases that explore interdisciplinary digital scholarship research and teaching methods. We welcome Trico faculty new to digital scholarship as well as those interested in taking their existing skills to the next level. You can expect to gain experience with fundamental digital scholarship tools and methods including navigating your computer via the command line, cleaning messy data, practicing version control, and sharing your work publicly, while also learning about support for grant opportunities and digital scholarship support networks in the Trico and beyond.

The Digital Scholarship Research Institute will be hosted online on two consecutive Friday afternoons, June 4 and 11, on Zoom. Please register by March 31.

We look forward to seeing you this summer! 😎
